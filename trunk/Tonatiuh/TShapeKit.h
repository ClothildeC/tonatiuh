    The development of Tonatiuh was supported from May 2004 to October    
    2006 by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable     
    Energy Laboratory (NREL) under the Minority Research Associate (MURA) 
    Program Subcontract ACQ-4-33623-06 with the University of Texas at    
    Brownsville (UTB).							   						  
 															   			  
    Since June 2006, the development of Tonatiuh is supported by	   	   
    the Spanish National Renewable Energy Centre (CENER), which has 	   
    established a permanent Tonatiuh software development team, under 	   
    the direction of Dr. Manuel J. Blanco, Director of CENER's Solar 	   
    Thermal Energy Department, Full-Professor of UTB, and former 	   	   
    Principal Investigator of the MURA Program Subcontract ACQ-4-33623-06.
 									   									   
    Support for the validation of Tonatiuh is also provided by NREL as	   
    in-kind contribution under the framework of the Memorandum 	   	   
    of Understanding between NREL and CENER (MOU#NREL-07-117) signed on
