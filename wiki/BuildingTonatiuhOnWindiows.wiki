#summary Instructions to download the Tonatiuh source code and build the latest SVN version of the program in your computer under Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7.

= Introduction =

Whether you want to collaborate in the development of Tonatiuh, you want to develop your own Tonatiuh plug-ins, or you just want to use the latest version of the program without between formal official program releases, you need to access the Tonatiuh Subversion repository and be able to build the Tonatiuh program from the source code.

Here you will find the instructions to configure Eclipse to both access the Tonatiuh Suversion repository and building the program and its official plug-ins from the source code.

== Obtaining a local copy of Tonatiuh ==

To build Tonatiuh using the C++ Eclipse IDE, the first thing you need to do is to download the Tonatiuh source code from the Subversion repository at Googlecode. To do this, execute Eclipse, click on the "Window" option in the menu bar, then click on "Open Perspective" and select "SVN Repository Exploring" as the perspective to open.

Once the "SVN Repository Exploring" is open under Eclipse, right click on the middle of the left panel titled "SVN Repositories". A pop-up menu will be displayed showing only one option titled "New". Left-click on it, and select the option titled "Repository Location..." (see Figure 1).

This will display a pop-up dialog, with several tabs. Under the _"General"_ tab, in the dialog's URL field enter _"http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"_, then in the _"Label"_ section check either the option _"Use repository URL as label"_ or the option _"Use a custom label"_. If you select the second option, you need to provide the custom label you want to use to designate Tonatiuh's SVN repository at Googlecode.

If you are a member of the Tonatiuh software development team, enter your username and password, in the _"Authetication"_ section of the _"General"_ tab of the pop-up dialog.  If you are not a member of the team, leave this section blank to make an anonimous download of the Tonatiuh code.

Finally, check the option _"Validate Repository Location on finish"_, and click on the "Finish" button. After doing this, you will see the tree of the Tonatiuh Subversion code repository at Google code. To download the Tonatiuh code, including the code of the official Tonatiuh plug-ins, please, expand the _"trunk"_ subtree and right-click on the _"TonatiuhProject"_ folder. By doing this, you will trigger the display of a pop-up menu. On that menu, select the _"Check Out"_ option (see Figure 2). This will start the process of downloading the Tonatiuh code into your computer.

[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/eclipse/tonatiuhPropertiesWindows.png]
 * Add new variables: 
  ** Name: TDE_ROOT, Value: C:/sde/msys/usr.
  ** Name: PATH, Value: C:/sde/MinGW/bin;C:/sde/msys/usr/qt/bin;C:/sde/msys/usr/local/bin.
  ** Name: QMAKESPEC, Value: win32-g++.

 * Define the first Make Target as:
  ** Target Name: qmake
  ** Make Target: src/Tonatiuh.pro
  ** Build command: qmake
 * Add new Make Target as:
  ** Target Name: all
  ** Make Target: all
  ** Build command: mingw32-make
 * To generate Makefile run "qmake". When the qmake command finishes run "all".

==Building Plugins==
To building repository plugins follow the same steps used to build Toantiuh application. On qmake target replace Tonatiuh.pro name with plugin .pro file.
