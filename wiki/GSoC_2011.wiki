= Introduction =

The Tonatiuh project is applying this year, for the first time, to the Google Summer of Code program. As it is stated in the [http://www.google-melange.com/ Google Summer of Code 2011 site], _Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects._

If you are a student developer and you are interested in participating in the GSoC program with the Tonatiuh project, please, get in contact with us after reading the information contained in this page and in the links it refers to.

To get acquainted with the GSoC program, please, read:

  * [http://code.google.com/soc/ General information about the GSoC program]
  * [http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline GSoC programm timeline]
  * [http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/ The student guide to GSoC]

= Requirements to participate in GSoC with Tonatiuh =

If you plan to participate in the GSoC with Tonatiuh, please, note that during the 12 weeks of the duration of your student project you have to comply with the following requirements:

  * Be able to work full-time in your student project for the full duration of 12 weeks.
  * Held weekly project status review sessions with your assigned mentor via the Tonatiuh project IRC channel on Freenode (#tonatiuhrt) or Skype internet videoconferencing.
  * Submit to [http://tonatiuhchronicles.blogspot.com/ Tonatiuh's blog] weekly posts summarizing the progress of your project.
  * Communicate with your assigned mentor as often as you need to keep your project moving forward and on schedule, using the Tonatiuh project IRC channel and the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tonatiuh-raytracer Tonatiuh's users and developers group] at Google groups.

It is known that the best student candidates are those that get involved in the project early, well before the selection deadline. Thus, if you are serious about participating with us in the GSoC, please, do the following:

  * Read the instruction on this wiki to set up your Tonatiuh development environment in the operating system of your choice (Windows, Linux or Mac), 
  * Get the Tonatiuh code and build it, 
  * Review our list of propose student projects (see below), and 
  * Get in contact with us via the Tonatiuh project IRC channel on Freenode (#tonatiuhrt) or the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tonatiuh-raytracer Tonatiuh's users and developers group].

In general, the more you show initiative in getting started with the above and in preparing your application, the more we will be willing to spend time interacting you and to help you in preparing your application to the GSoC program. We look forward to hearing from you!

= Proposed Student Projects =

== Import and export of 3D geometry from standard formats ==

We would like Tonatiuh to import and export 3D geometry from standard file formats such as AutoCAD (.dxf), Stereolithography (.stl), 3D Studio (.3ds), Virtual Reality Modeling Lenguage (.vrml), X3D XML (.x3d), !LuxRender (.LXS), or Google's Sketchup (.skp).

Not all of the mentioned formats are expected to be addressed in one student project. Several student projects could be defined with each project addressing one or two of the formats.

  * Contact person: [https://profiles.google.com/manuel.jesus.blanco/about/edit/d?hl=en_US Manuel J. Blanco]
  * Level of difficulty: Hard / Medium
  * Must know: The student should be familiar with the 3D format or formats he or she decides to focus on.
  * Language: C++
  * Priority: High

== Enhancement of Tonatiuh scripting capabilities ==

Although Tonatiuh already offers the user some scripting capabilities based on the Qt scripting technologies. It is desirable to review and greatly expand these capabilities, in order to make it possible for Tonatiuh's users to do:
  * Batch processing, so that long-running tasks can be automated or run as processes separated from the Graphics User Interface (GUI.
  * Automated testing, so that by using a scripting interface to the application, Tonatiuh developers can automatically exercise the application to verify that the GUI behaves as expected.
