= Details =

Download the latest release of Coin, currently [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz Coin 3.1.0], from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website to your downloads directory, e.g.,_/home/username/downloads_. 

Open a shell console and navigate to desktop and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.0.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.0.0_ in your user directory. Using shell navigate to just created Coin3.0.0 directory and type:
{{{
./configure
}}}

This will start the configuration process. Depending on your computer, this process may take some time to finish. When it does, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make 
make install
}}}

The installation process may take several hours. 

Now, [InstallingSoQtForLinux SoQt] installation can be started.
