= Details =

Download the latest realese of Coin, currently [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.0.0.tar.gz Coin 3.0.0], from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website at http://www.coin3d.org/lib/plonesoftwarecenter_view. Place it into the user directory under your MSYS folder.  This will typically be _c:\msys\usr\home\username_.
 
Open an MSYS shell console. Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.0.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.0.0_ in your user directory. Using the MSYS shell navigate to just created Coin3.0.0 directory and type:
{{{
export QTDIR="/usr/qt"_
export COINDIR="/usr/local"_
export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/qt/include"
./configure LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CXXFLAGS="-mno-cygwin"  --disable-msvc --without-mesa --without-x --prefix=/usr/local
}}}

This will start the configuration process. Depending on your computer, this process may take some time to finish. When it does, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make 
make install
}}}

The installation process may take several hours . During it you may get errors, that may trigger warnings in the MSYS shell console complemented with instructions on how to solve them. If that is the case, follow the instructions that appear on the screen to fix the errors. In those cases in which you may get an error, but no instruction on how to solvw it, re-launch the make or the install process by typing "make" or "make install" as appropriate.

At the end of the installation process, edit the file _'/usr/local/include/Inventor/C/basic.h'_ to add the following lines at the top:
{{{
#ifndef COIN_DLL 
#define COIN_DLL
#endif
}}}

Now, [InstallingSoQt SoQt] installation can be started.
