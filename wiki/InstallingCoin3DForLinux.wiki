To install de Coin3D library in your computer download the latest release of the installer file, _Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz_, from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website by clicking [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz here]. Place it on your "downloads" directory, e.g., _/home/downloads_.

Open a shell console and navigate to desktop and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.1.0_ in your user directory. Using shell navigate to just created Coin3.1.0 directory. Type the following command to build on debug mode: 
{{{
./configure --enable-debug --enable-symbols --with-suffix=_debug
}}}

Or type to release mode:
{{{
./configure
}}}

This will start the configuration process. Depending on your computer, this process may take some time to finish. When it does, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make 
make install
}}}

The installation process may take several hours. 

Now, [InstallingSoQtForLinux SoQt] installation can be started.
