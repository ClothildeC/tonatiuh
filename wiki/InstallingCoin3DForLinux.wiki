To install de Coin3D library in your computer download the latest release of the installer file, _Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz_, from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website by clicking [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz here]. Place it on your "downloads" directory, e.g., _/home/downloads_.

Open a shell console, navigate to your download directory, and extract the content of the installer file by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.1.0_ in your download directory. Using the shell, navigate to just created Coin3.1.0 directory.

Type the following command to build the debug version of the Coin3D library:
{{{
./configure --enable-debug --enable-symbols --with-suffix=_debug
}}}

Type the following command to build the release version of the Coin3D library:
{{{
./configure
}}}

This will start the configuration process. Depending on your computer, this process may take some time to finish. When it does, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make 
make install
}}}

The installation process may take several hours.

At the end of the installation process, the libraries will be installed at /usr/local/lib. Now, you can proceed to the installation of [InstallingSoQtForLinux SoQt].
