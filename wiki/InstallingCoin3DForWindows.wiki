[http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] is a high-level 3D graphics toolkit for developing cross-platform real-time 3D visualization and visual simulation software. Install [InstallingQtForWindows Qt] before start with the installation.

= Details =

Download the latest realese of Coin, currently [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz Coin 3.1.0], from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website at http://www.coin3d.org/lib/plonesoftwarecenter_view. Place it into the user directory under your MSYS folder.  This will typically be _c:\sde\msys\usr\home\username_.

*(Note: If you are using Windows XP, be sure the operating system does not change the extension of the file from ".tar.gz" to ".tar.tar" while it is dowloading it. If it does, after downloading the file change its extension back to ".tar.gz")*

Open an MSYS shell console. Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.1.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.1.0_ in your user directory. Using the MSYS shell navigate to just created Coin-3.1.0 directory and type:
{{{
export QTDIR="/usr/qt"_
export COINDIR="/usr/local"_
export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/qt/include"
}}}

Type the following command to build on debug mode: 
{{{
./configure --disable-msvc --enable-qt-debug --with-suffix=d
}}}
Or type to release mode:
{{{
./configure --disable-msvc --enable-debug=no --enable-symbols=no
}}}

This will start the configuration process. Depending on your computer, this process may take some time to finish. When it does, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make 
make install
}}}

The installation process may take several hours . During it you may get errors, that may trigger warnings in the MSYS shell console complemented with instructions on how to solve them. If that is the case, follow the instructions that appear on the screen to fix the errors. In those cases in which you may get an error, but no instruction on how to solvw it, re-launch the make or the install process by typing "make" or "make install" as appropriate.

Once the Coin3D library is installed the next step is to install the !SoQt library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingSoQt InstallingSoQt]
