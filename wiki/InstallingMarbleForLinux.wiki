#summary This will guide you through the Marble Installation for Linux in order to develop the Tonatiuh project.

= Marble - Desktop Globe =

Marble is a Virtual Globe and World Atlas that you can use to learn more about Earth: You can pan and zoom around and you can look up places and roads. A mouse click on a place label will provide the respective Wikipedia article.

= Details =

To compile marble you need CMake, a cross-platform make. You can obtain it from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html. Download the last version of cmake for windows, you need a version newer than 2.4. Install CMake at _C:\CMake_version_.

Now, download the source files from http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Marble+-+Desktop+Globe?content=55105 clicking on _Source download_ link. Place it into downloads under your home folder. This will typically be  /home/username/downloads. Open a shell console and navigate to downloads directory. Extract the archive by typing: 

{{{
tar -xvzf marble-version.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _marble-version_ in your user directory. Using the shell navigate to just created marble-version directory and type:
{{{
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DQTONLY=ON ../marble
make
make install
}}}


Marble is installed, but we have to put maps data files in Tonatiuh project. If you have not Tonatiuh project created, follow procedures to  [InstallatingAndConfiguringEclipseForLinux install and configurate Eclipse for Linux] and [Installing_Subversive install Subversive] to take sources from the repository.
