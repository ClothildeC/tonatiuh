#summary This will guide you through the Marble Installation for Mac in order to develop the Tonatiuh project.

= Marble - Desktop Globe =

==Introduction==
Marble is a Virtual Globe and World Atlas that you can use to learn more about Earth: You can pan and zoom around and you can look up places and roads. A mouse click on a place label will provide the respective Wikipedia article.

==Details ==
To compile marble you need CMake, a cross-platform make. You can obtain it from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html. Download the last version of cmake for unix, you need a version newer than 2.4. Install CMake at _/usr/local_ by:
{{{
tar xvf cmake-version.tar
./configure
make
make install
}}}

Now, download the source files from http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Marble+-+Desktop+Globe?content=55105 clicking on _Source download_ link. Place it into downloads under your home folder. This will typically be  /home/username/downloads. Open a shell console and navigate to downloads directory. Extract the archive by typing: 

{{{
tar xvf marble-version.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _marble-version_ in your user directory. Using the shell navigate to just created marble-version directory and type:
{{{
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DQTONLY=ON ../marble
make
make install
}}}

To install marble in debug mode type:
{{{
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=debug -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=_debug -DQTONLY=ON ../marble
make
make install
}}}


Copy header and lib files to working directory:
{{{
mkdir /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/AbstractLayer/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/data/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/handlers/dgml/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/handlers/gpx/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/handlers/kml/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/parser/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/geodata/scene/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/gps/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/Projections/*.h /usr/local/include/marble 
cp src/lib/libmarblewidget.* /usr/local/lib
}}}
