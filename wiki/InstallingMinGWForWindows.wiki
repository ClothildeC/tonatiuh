A window will popup asking you if you want to excute the file or store it in your computer. Store it in your PC and, after that, execute it.
 
During the execution of the installer, select just the g++ compiler to install. Then, accept the suggestion of installing the program in the C:\MinGW directory, and you are done.

Once MinGW is properly installed, the next step is to install the MSYS shell environment. To do this follow the instruction in the correspondigne wiki page [Installing_MSYS_for_Windows].
