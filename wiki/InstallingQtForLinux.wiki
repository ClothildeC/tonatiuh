[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for GUI development. In the Tonatiuh development, the las Qt version, Qt-4.7, is used. If this version is not available from the SO software management tool, configure it following the these steps.

= Details =

To install the Qt SDK in your computer download the latest release of the installer file, _qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2010.05.1.bin_ , from the [http://www.qtsoftware.com/ Qt] website by clicking [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-linux-x11-32bit-cpp here]. Place it on your "downloads" directory, e.g., _/home/downloads_.

Open a shell console, navigate to the downloads directory and run it by typing:
{{{
chmod u+x qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2010.05.1.bin
sudo ./qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2010.05.1.bin
}}}

This will open an installation wizard.During the execution of the installer do the following:
  * Check the _"I accept the terms of the License Agreement"_ and click the _"Next_ button.
  * Enter _"/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7"_ as the destination folder
  * Select the following components to install:
    * _"Qt Creator"_
    * _"Qt Development Libraries"_

After the Qt libraries are installed, you must add the appropriate information to your $PATH. To do that, edit the .bashrc file with your favorite editor to include the following at the end of the file:
{{{
QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7/qt
export QTDIR

PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
export PATH

}}}

Once the Qt libraries and development tools (including Qt creator) are installed, the next step is to install the [InstallingSimageForLinux Simage] library.
