#summary Procedure to install Qt for Linux

[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for GUI development. 

= Details =

To install the Qt libraries in your computer download the installer file _qt-x11-opensource-src-4.5.1.tar.gz_ from the Trolltech website at http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/linux-x11-cpp on your "downloads" directory, e.g., _/home/username/downloads_.

Open a shell console, navigate to the downloads directory and extract the donwloaded file by typing:
{{{
tar -xvzf qt-x11-opensource-src-4.5.1.tar.gz
}}}

This will create the new directory "qt-x11-opensource-src-4.5.1" under your downloads directory. Navigate within the command shell to the directory and type:
{{{
./configure
}}}

You will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it by typing "yes". 

Once the configuration of qt finishes, make and install the libraries by typing:
{{{
make
make install
}}}

In some systems, to run "make install" you will need to start a superuser session within your command shell.

After the Qt libraries are installed, you must add the appropriate information to your $PATH. To do that, edit the .bashrc file with your favorite editor to include the following at the end of the file:
{{{
QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.4.3
export QTDIR

PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
export PATH

}}}

Once this is done, save the changes and close the editor.
