Qt is cross-platform application framework for GUI development. 

= Details =

To install the Qt libraries in your computer download the installer file _qt-x11-opensource-src-4.4.3.tar.gz_ from the Trolltech website at http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource/appdev/linux-x11-cpp and execute it.

Once the installer is running, you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it and click "Next>". Then, you will be asked to enter the destination folder. Enter _C:\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "Next>". When you will askied to MinGW installation folder enter _C:\MinGW_ and click "Install".

After the release version of the Qt libraries are installed, you can create the debug version of the libraries, by selecting Start->All Programs->Qt by Nokia v4.4.3 (OpenSource)->Qt 4.4.3 (Build Debug Libraries). This will open a console Window. Within it you will get the following message:

{{{
"Setting up a MinGW/Qt only environment...
-- QTDIR set to C:\msys\usr\qt
-- PATH set to C:\msys\usr\qt\bin
-- Adding C:\MinGW\bin to PATH
-- Adding C:\Windows\System32 to PATH
-- QMAKESPEC set to win32-g++


This will configure and compile qt in debug.
The release libraries will not be recompiled.
Press any key to continue..."
}}}

Press any key to start the configuration and compilation process of the debug versions of the Qt libraries. Depending on your computer, this process  may take several hours to complete.
