Qt is cross-platform application framework for GUI development. 

= Details =

To install the Qt libraries in your computer download the source files from the Trolltech website at http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-src-4.5.2.tar.gz .

Once the download ha finished, open a shell and go to download directory and extract files:
{{{
tar -xvf qt-mac-opensource-src-4.5.2.tar
}}}

After extraction, a new directory, qt-mac-opensource-src-4.5.2, will be created. Go to the directory and type: 
{{{
./configure -debug-and-release -no-framework - universal
}}}
You will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it typing yes. 

After qt configuration is finished, to install qt libraries typing: 
{{{
make
make install
}}}

Now, Qt libraries are installed, we must specify where Qt is installed. Type: 

{{{
$ vi ~/.profile 
}}}

Type "e" to be able to write in the file. We should add the following text: 
{{{
PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.5.2/bin:$PATH 
export PATH 
QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.5.2 
export QTDIR 
}}}

Save chages with:
{{{
ESC
:wq
}}}
