[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for Graphics User Interface (GUI) development. This application framework is implemented as a set of related libraries. The Qt libraries are used within Tonatiuh to implement the program's GUI, the plug-in architecture, the parallel processing functionality, and the scripting capabilities, among other things.

Here you will find instructions to install the Qt libraries in your computer and make those libraries available for the development of Tonatiuh.

Download the latest installer of the Qt SDK for Windows. To do it, click on the following [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads link] to go to the "Downloads" webpage of the Qt website. Once you reach the webpage, click on the link titled _"Qt SDK for Windows* (322 MB)"_ (see Figure 1). This will start the downloading of the Qt SDK for Windows installer. When prompted if to open or to store the file in your computer, select the appropriate option to store the file in your computer.

After saving the installer in your computer, execute it by left-clicking twice on it. 

Once the installer is running, you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it and click "Next>". Then, you will be asked to enter the destination folder. Enter _C:\sde\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "Next>". When you will asked for the MinGW installation folder enter _C:\sde\MinGW_ and click "Install".

At this point you may get a warning like this:
{{{
There is a problem with your MinGW installation:
The installer could not find a valid C:\sde\MinGW\include\w32api.h
(The supported version is 3.2)
Do you still want to continue? (Your installation may not work)
}}}
Ignore the warning and click on the "Yes" button to indicate that you do want to continue.

Once the Qt libraries are installed the next step is to install the Simage library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingSimageForWindows Simage]
