[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for Graphics User Interface (GUI) development. This application framework is implemented as a set of related libraries. The Qt libraries are used within Tonatiuh to implement the program's GUI, the plug-in architecture, the parallel processing functionality, and the scripting capabilities, among other things.

Here you will find instructions to install the Qt libraries in your computer and make those libraries available for the development of Tonatiuh.

= Details =

To install the Qt libraries in your PC download the latest installer of the Qt SDK for Windows from the [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads Qt website downloads page]. After saving the installer in your computer, execute it by left-clicking twice on it. 

Once the installer is running, you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it and click "Next>". Then, you will be asked to enter the destination folder. Enter _C:\sde\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "Next>". When you will asked for the MinGW installation folder enter _C:\sde\MinGW_ and click "Install".

At this point you may get a warning like this:
{{{
There is a problem with your MinGW installation:
The installer could not find a valid C:\sde\MinGW\include\w32api.h
(The supported version is 3.2)
Do you still want to continue? (Your installation may not work)
}}}
Ignore the warning and click on the "Yes" button to indicate that you do want to continue.

Once the Qt libraries are installed the next step is to install the Simage library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingSimageForWindows Simage]
