To install the Qt libraries for Open Source C++ development on Windows in your computer download the installer file [http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/windows-cpp qt-win-opensource-4.5.2-mingw.exe] from the [http://www.qtsoftware.com/ Qt] website and execute it.

Once the installer is running, you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it and click "Next>". Then, you will be asked to enter the destination folder. Enter _C:\sde\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "Next>". When you will asked for the MinGW installation folder enter _C:\sde\MinGW_ and click "Install".

At this point you may get a warning like this:
{{{
There is a problem with your MinGW installation:
The installer could not find a valid C:\sde\MinGW\include\w32api.h
(The supported version is 3.2)
Do you still want to continue? (Your installation may not work)
}}}
Ignore the warning and click on the "Yes" button to indicate that you do want to continue.
