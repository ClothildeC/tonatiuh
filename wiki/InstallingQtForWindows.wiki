[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for GUI development. 

= Details =

To install the Qt libraries in your computer download the installer file _qt-win-opensource-4.4.3-mingw.exe_ from the Trolltech website at http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource/appdev/windows-cpp and execute it.

Once the installer is running, you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Accept it and click "next". Then, you will be asked to enter the destination folder. Enter _C:\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "install".

After the release version of the Qt libraries are installed, you can create the debug version of the libraries, by selecting Start->All Programs->Qt by Trolltech 4.2.1(Build Debug Libraries). This will open a console Window. Within it you will get the following message:

{{{
"Setting up a MinGW/Qt only environment...
-- QTDIR set to C:\msys\usr\qt
-- PATH set to C:\msys\usr\qt\bin
-- Adding C:\MinGW\bin to PATH
-- Adding C:\Windows\System32 to PATH
-- QMAKESPEC set to win32-g++


This will configure and compile qt in debug.
The release libraries will not be recompiled.
Press any key to continue..."
}}}

Press any key to start the configuration and compilation process of the debug versions of the Qt libraries. Depending on your computer, this process  may take several hours to complete.
