Enter _C:\msys\usr\qt\_, and click "Next>". When you will askied to MinGW installation folder enter _C:\MinGW_ and click "Install".

After the release version of the Qt libraries are installed, you can create the debug version of the libraries, by selecting Start->All Programs->Qt by Nokia v4.5.1 ( OpenSource )->Qt 4.5.1 (Build Debug Libraries). This will open a console Window. Within it you will get the following message:
