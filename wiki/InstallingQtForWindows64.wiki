#summary Instructions to install the Qt libraries needed to develop Tonatiuh under Windows 64 Bit.

= Introduction =
[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for Graphics User Interface (GUI) development. This application framework is implemented as a set of related libraries. The Qt libraries are used within Tonatiuh to implement the program's GUI, the plug-in architecture, the parallel processing functionality, and the scripting capabilities, among other things.

Here you will find instructions to install the Qt libraries in your computer and make those libraries available for the development of Tonatiuh.

Download the latest libraries sources of the Qt . To do it, click on the following [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads link]. Once you reach the webpage, go to the _"Qt library"_ section and click on the link to download the source code in the fortat that you like (see Figure 1).

Once the source code package is on your PC, place it into the user directory under your MSYS folder. This will typically be _"C:\sde\MinGW\msys\usr\home\username"_. Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive. 

To solve some compilation errors, change the following:
  * File /qmake/Makefile.win32-g++-sh, line 31:
  {{{
  -LIBS	    = -lole32 -luuid
  +LIBS	    = -lole32 -luuid -ladvapi32 -lkernel32
  }}} 

  * File qmake/qmake.pri, (line 138):
  {{{
  -   win32-g++*:LIBS += -lole32 -luuid
  +   win32-g++*:LIBS += -lole32 -luuid -ladvapi32 -lkernel32
  }}}

  * File src/corelib/global/qglobal.h (lines 1135-1136):
  {{{
  -typedef long Q_LONG;             /* word up to 64 bit signed */
  -typedef unsigned long Q_ULONG;   /* word up to 64 bit unsigned */
  +typedef long long Q_LONG;             /* word up to 64 bit signed */
  +typedef unsigned long long Q_ULONG;   /* word up to 64 bit unsigned */
  }}}

  * File src/3rdparty/webkit/JavaScriptCore/wtf/Platform.h (line 940) ,append:
  {{{
  #elif CPU(X86_64) && OS(WINDOWS) && COMPILER(MINGW64) && GCC_VERSION >= 40100
 #define ENABLE_JIT 0
  }}}

Once the changes are made, open a MSYS shell and navigate to your MSYS user directory and type:
{{{
cd qt-version
configure.exe -platform win32-g++ -phonon -debug-and-release 
mingw32-make
}}}

The installation process may take several hours. Once the Qt libraries and development tools are installed, the next step is to install the Simage library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingSimageForWindows64 Simage]
