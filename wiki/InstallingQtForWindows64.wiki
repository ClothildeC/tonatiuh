[http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/qt/qtLogo.png]

Qt is cross-platform application framework for Graphics User Interface (GUI) development. This application framework is implemented as a set of related libraries. The Qt libraries are used within Tonatiuh to implement the program's GUI, the plug-in architecture, the parallel processing functionality, and the scripting capabilities, among other things.

Here you will find instructions to install the Qt libraries in your computer and make those libraries available for the development of Tonatiuh.

Once the source code package is on your PC, extract the file to "C:\sde" directory.

Then, open a MSYS shell and navigate "C:\sde" directory and type:
{{{
cd qt-version
configure.exe -platform win32-g++ -phonon -debug-and-release 
make
}}}

The installation process may take several hours. Once the Qt libraries and development tools are installed, the next step is to install the Simage library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingSimageForWindows64 Simage]
