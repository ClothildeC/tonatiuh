#summary Instructions to install the SoQt library needed to develop Tonatiuh under Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

!SoQt is a library that provides the glue between the Coin 3D libraries and the Qt 2D GUI and application framework libraries. The !SoQt library is used within Tonatiuh mainly to implement different types of Coin 3D scene viewers inside traditional 2D Qt-generated windows.

Here you will find instructions to install the !SoQt library in your computer and make this library available for the development of Tonatiuh.

= Details =

Before installing !SoQt, please, verify that the Qt and Coin 3D libraries are already properly installed in your computer. If they are not, install them first by following the corresponding procedures to [InstallingQtForWindows installing Qt] and [InstallingCoin3DForWindows installing Coin].

Download the latest release of !SoQt, currently !SoQt 1.5.0, from the Coin3D website at http://www.coin3d.org/lib/plonesoftwarecenter_view. The file you have to download is !SoQt-1.5.0.tar.gz. 

*(Note: If you are using Windows XP, be sure the operating system does not change the extension of the file from ".tar.gz" to ".tar.tar" while it is dowloading it. If it does, after downloading the file change its extension back to ".tar.gz")*

Place the downloaded file into the user directory under your MSYS folder. This will typically be c:\sde\msys\usr\home\username. Open an MSYS shell console. Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf SoQt-1.5.0.tar.gz
}}}
This will create a directory called _!SoQt-1.5.0_ in your user directory. Using the MSYS shell navigate to the just created SoQt-1.5.0. directory and type:
{{{
export QTDIR=/c/sde/Qt/2010.05/qt
export COINDIR=/usr/local
export INCLUDE=/usr/local/include:/c/sde/MinGW/include
export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
export QMAKESPEC=$QTDIR/mkspecs/win32-g++
}}}

The configure command to build libraries in release mode is:
{{{
./configure --disable-msvc --enable-debug=no --enable-symbols=no
}}}
This will start the configuration process. This process should finish succesfully with the following message:
{{{
"SoQt configuration settings:
  Open Inventor brand: Coin
  Static Materials:    Yes
  Installation Prefix: /usr/local

Now, run 'make install'to build and install SoQt"
}}} 

Type "make" to build !SoQt and then "make install" to install it.

Once the !SoQt library is installed the next step is to install the Marble library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: InstallingMarbleForWindows
