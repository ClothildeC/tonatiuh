#summary How to install Coin3d for Windows from the source code

[http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] is a high-level 3D graphics toolkit for developing cross-platform real-time 3D visualization and visual simulation software. Install [Installing_QT_for_Windows Qt] before start with the installation.

Download the latest realese of Coin, currently [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-3.0.0.tar.gz Coin 3.0.0], from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website at http://www.coin3d.org/lib/plonesoftwarecenter_view. Place it into the user directory under your MSYS folder.  This will typically be _c:\msys\usr\home\username_.
 
Open an MSYS shell console. Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive by typing:

{{{
tar -zxvf Coin-3.0.0.tar.gz
}}}

This will create a directory called _Coin-3.0.0_ in your user directory. After this directory is created, using the MSYS shell navigate to your home directory and type:
{{{
mkdir coin_build_
export QTDIR="/usr/qt"_
export COINDIR="/usr/local"_
export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/qt/include"
}}}

Then, enter the just created coin_build folder and run the configure command typing:
{{{
cd coin-build_
../Coin-2/configure LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CXXFLAGS="-mno-cygwin"  --disable-msvc --without-mesa --without-x --prefix=/usr/local
}}}

After the configuration process ends, install the Coin3D libraries by typing:
{{{
make install
}}}

After the installation process ends, you must then manually edit the file '/usr/local/include/Inventor/C/basic.h' by adding the following lines to the top of the file:
{{{
#ifndef COIN_DLL 
#define COIN_DLL
#endif
}}}

Now, [Installing_SoQt SoQt] installation can be started.
