#summary How to install Coin3d for Windows from the source code

[http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] is a high-level 3D graphics toolkit for developing cross-platform real-time 3D visualization and visual simulation software. Install [Installing_QT_for_Windows Qt] before start with the installation.

 # Download the realese of Coin for all platforms, now [http://ftp.coin3d.org/coin/src/all/Coin-2.5.0.tar.gz Coin 2.5.0], from the [http://www.coin3d.org/ Coin3D] website at http://www.coin3d.org/lib/plonesoftwarecenter_view into the user directory under your MSYS folder.  This will typically be _c:\msys\usr\home\username_.
 # Navigate to your MSYS user directory and extract the archive from the file you just downloaded using WinZip or another extraction tool.  This should create a directory called _Coin-2##_ in your user directory.
 # Using MSYS shell navigate to your home directory and create a new folder called _coin_build_ by typing the following in the command prompt:
  * _cd /home/username_
  * _mkdir coin_build_
 # Next you need to set 3 environment variables. Type the following commands:
  * _export QTDIR="/usr/qt"_
  * _export COINDIR="/usr/local"_
  * _export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/qt/include"_
 # Enter in the coin_build folder and run configure command:
  * _./../Coin-2/configure LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CXXFLAGS="-mno-cygwin"  --disable-msvc --without-mesa --without-x --prefix=/usr/local_
 # After the configuration has finished running, you can install Coin3D simply by typing 'make install'.
 # You must then manually edit the file '/usr/local/include/Inventor/C/basic.h' by adding the following lines to the top of the file:
  * _#ifndef COIN_DLL #define COIN_DLL #endif_

Now, [Installing_SoQt SoQt] installation can be started.
