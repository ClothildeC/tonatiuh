#summary How to install SoQt from source code

SoQt is a library that provides the glue between Systems in Motion's Coin high-level 3D visualization library and Troll Tech's Qt 2D user interface library.

 # Download 'SoQt-latest.tar.gz' from the ftp site at http://ftp.coin3d.org/snapshots/ into the user directory under your MSYS folder.  This will typically be c:\msys\usr\home\username
 # Navigate to your user directory and extract the archive from the file you just downloaded using WinZip or another extraction tool.  This should create a directory called 'SoQt' in your user directory.
 # Using MSYS navigate to your home home directory and create a new folder called 'coin_build' by typing the following in the command prompt, 'mkdir soqt_build'
 # Next you need to set 3 environment variables by typing in the following commands one at a time: export QTDIR="/usr/qt" export COINDIR="/usr/local" export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/qt/include"
 # Enter the coin_build folder and run the command ./../SoQt/configure LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" CXXFLAGS="-mno-cygwin"  --disable-msvc --without-mesa --without-x --with-coin=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local
 # After the configuration has finished running, you can install SoQt by typing 'make install'
