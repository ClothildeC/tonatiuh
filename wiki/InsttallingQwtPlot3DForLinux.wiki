Download the latest realese of QwtPlot3D, currently QwtPlot3D 0.2.7, from the QwtPlot3D website at http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/web/navigation/download_frame.html. Place it into downlaods on your home directory. Open a shell console, navigate to download directory directory and extract the archive by typing:

line 7: MOC_DIR           = tmp
line 8: OBJECTS_DIR       = tmp
line 15: win32:TEMPLATE    = vclib
}}}

And add to end of the file:
{{{
contains(TEMPLATE,lib) { 
	CONFIG(debug, debug|release) {
		TARGET = $$member(TARGET, 0)_debug
	} 
} 
}}}

Using the shell navigate to the just created directory and type: 
{{{
export QTDIR="/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.5.2"
qmake qwtplot3d.pro
make -f Makefile.Debug
make -f Makefile.Release
}}}

The library is created. Now, to put it into local:
