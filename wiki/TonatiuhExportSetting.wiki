#summary This page shows the parameters available to define the data to save in the simulations.

Tonatiuh generates a large amount of information when a simulation is executed. However, the user may not need all this information and consequently some of the information can be discarded. Tonatiuh, before start a simulation, asks what data the user want to save for the analysis.

==Type of store ==

First the user must define the type of store for the photon map. Tonatiuh v2.0.1 has three ways to save simulation data.

  * _*QSL_Database*_: The data is stored into a database in which the information is accessible using SQL statements. In this database three tables are created:
    * Photons: this table saves all the information about photons. Information related to each photon depends on the parameters that the user wants to save.
