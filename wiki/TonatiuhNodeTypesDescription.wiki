=Tonatiuh Scene=

A scene consists of one or more nodes hierarchically oredered.  To create scenes, the nodes are added as children of grouping nodes.


= Type of Nodes =

A node is each of the elements of the scene containing the data and methods to define the geometries, properties, ... of the scene.

== TSeparatorKit node ==
Is a node that groups other nodes of the scene. This type of node can group nodes of the same type or TShapeKit node types. 

The user can define the following paramenters to this group node:

 * translation: the translation in x, y, and z. The default value is [0.0 0.0 0.0].
 * rotation: the rotation in terms of an axis and an angle. The default value is [0.0 0.0 1.0], 0.0.
 * scaleFactor: the scaling factor in x, y, and z. The default value is [1.0 1.0 1.0].
 * scaleOrientation: the rotation to apply before the scale is applied. The default value is [0.0 0.0 1.0], 0.0.
 * center: the center point for rotation and scaling. The default value is [0.0 0.0 0.0].
 
The parameters are applied so that the the center parameter affects first,followed by the scale orientation, the scaling factor, the rotation, and the translation.

== TShapeKit node ==

== Shape node ==

== Material node ==

== Tracker node ==
