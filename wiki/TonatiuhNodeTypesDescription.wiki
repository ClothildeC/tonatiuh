=Tonatiuh Scene=

A scene consists of one or more nodes hierarchically oredered.  To create scenes, the nodes are added as children of grouping nodes.

= Type of Nodes =

A node is each of the elements of the scene containing the data and methods to define the geometries, properties, ... of the scene.

== TSeparatorKit node [http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/userguide/separatorKit.png]==
Is a node that groups other nodes of the scene. This type of node can group nodes of the same type or TShapeKit type nodes. 

The user can define the following paramenters to this group node:

 * translation: the translation in x, y, and z. The default value is (0.0 0.0 0.0).
 * rotation: the rotation in terms of an axis and an angle. The default value is (0.0 0.0 1.0), 0.0.
 * scaleFactor: the scaling factor in x, y, and z. The default value is (1.0 1.0 1.0).
 * scaleOrientation: the rotation to apply before the scale is applied. The default value is (0.0 0.0 1.0), 0.0.
 * center: the center point for rotation and scaling. The default value is (0.0 0.0 0.0).
 
The parameters are applied so that the the center parameter affects first,followed by the scale orientation, the scaling factor, the rotation, and the translation.

== TShapeKit node [http://tonatiuh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/userguide/shapeKit.png]==
Is also a group node. It croups the nodes that define a surface properties. TShapeKit can contain a shape node and a material node.


== Shape node ==
Is a node that defines a surface geometry. Node parameters depend on the selected shape node type. 

Shape nodes always are leaf nodes in the scene.

== Material node ==

Material nodes defines surfaces propersties and appearance characteristics as ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, emissive color, shininess, and transparency.

Material nodes always are leaf nodes in the scene.

== Tracker node ==
Tracker nodes are TSeparatorKit nodes children. In a TSeparatorKit node only can be one tracker node child.

These nodes change the parent node parameters automatically when a scene light position changes. If you define a TSeparatorKit node parameter value manually and this node has a tracker child, when the light position changes this value will be removed.
