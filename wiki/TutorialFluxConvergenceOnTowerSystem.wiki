= Introduction =

*The main aim of this tutorial is explain how to analyze the tonatiuh output data to stimate the flux distribution on the target.


= Characteristics of the system =

The system we want to simulate consists of:

* A tower.
* One heliostat.
* A flat plane as a receiver.

=General aspects of the system =

The system we are going to simulate is made up of a flat square of 15 x 15 meters located on the top of a cylindric tower of 150 meters heigth.
400 meters away of the tower, we are going to create a flat square with a surface of 60 m<sup>2</sup> . This flate rectangle called Heliostat is going to with an inclination of 45ยบ compared to the ground.
We are asumming that the solar concentrating system is placed in Sevilla, Spain at 11.00 A.M.
 
= Modeling the system =

== Modeling the tower ==
Once tonatiuh is opened, we have to select the RootNode and, then, add a TSeparator as a childen. The TSeparator
