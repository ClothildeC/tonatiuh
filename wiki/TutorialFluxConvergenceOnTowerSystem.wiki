#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

*The main aim of this tutorial is explain how to analyze the tonatiuh output data to stimate the flux distribution on the target.


= Characteristics of the system =

The system we want to simulate consists of:

 * A tower.
 * One heliostat.
 * A flat plane as a receiver.

=General aspects of the system =

The system we are going to simulate is made up of a flat square of 15 x 15 meters located on the top of a cylindric tower of 150 meters heigth.
400 meters away of the tower, we are going to create a flat square with a surface of 60 m<sup>2</sup> . This flate rectangle called Heliostat is going to with an inclination of 45ยบ compared to the ground.
We are asumming that the solar concentrating system is placed in Sevilla, Spain at 11.00 A.M.
 
= Modeling the system =

== Modeling the tower ==
 * Once tonatiuh is opened, we have to select the rootNode and, then, add a TSeparator as a childen. The TSeparator node is the blue circular buttom allocated on the icon bar.
 * When the node is created, rename it to "Tower". With this new node selected, create a new TSeparator as a node child and rename it to "Base".
 * If we select the "Base" node,we can add one shape on it. Only if we create first a TShape node (the red circle icon next to the blue one), we will be able to insert a shape.
 * With the TShape node, previously created, selected, we can add a shape. In this case, we are using a cylinder shape called cylinder. We can find it on the plugin menu bar.
