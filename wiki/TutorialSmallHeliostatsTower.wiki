#summary How to model a tower system with 500 one-facet small heliostats.

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains:

 * How to use “!Tracker_Heliostat” plug-ins to embed  solar tracking behavior within the Tonatiuh model of a solar concentrating system.
 * How to use the scripting capabilities of Tonatiuh to automate the use of the program to simulate the optical behavior of a tracking solar concentrating system as a function of the sun position in the sky.
 * How to use Mathematica to post-process the results generated by Tonatiuh to compute the solar flux distribution incident upon a flat rectangular surface.
 * How to combine Tonatiuh and Mathematica capabilities to generate a optical efficiency matrix to characterize the optical behavior of a tower system.
