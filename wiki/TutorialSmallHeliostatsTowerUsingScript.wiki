#summary How to model a tower system with 500 one-facet small heliostats using the Tonatiuh script tool.

= Introduction =

This tutorial is going to be an introduction to tonatiuh script tool, which will allow users to create easier solar concentrating systems.


= Main functions =

Those are the functions to develop a sytem by scripting. They are explained folling an alphabetic order:

{{{
ChangeSunPosition(double azimuth, double elevation) --> Sets the sun azimuth and sun elevation to those new values. The sun will be automatically  updated.

ChangeSunPosition(int year, int month, int day, double hours, double minutes, double seconds, double latitude, double longitude ) --> Sets the sun azimuth and sun elevation to the position the sun should be at the date and geographical position defined.

Copy()-->Copy the selected node.

Copy(QString nodeURL)-->Copy the nodeURL defined.

CreateGroupNode() --> Creates a separator node.

CreateAnalyzerNode() --> Creates an analyzer node.

CreateMaterial() --> Creates a material surface.

CreateShape() --> Creates a new shape.

CreateSurfaceNode() --> Creates a TShapeKit node.

}}}
