#summary Analysis of the flux distribution at the focal plane of a Parabolic Dish using Tonatiuh release 2.0.1

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains how to use Tonatiuh release 2.0.1 to model a parabolic dish and simulate its optical behaviour. It also explains how to use Mathematica to process the output from Tonatiuh to estimate the concentrated solar flux distribution at the focal plane of the parabolic dish and related parameters, such as the maximum radius of such distribution, i.e., the size of the solar radiation spot at the focal plane.

= The concentrating system to model = 

The parabolic dish we are going to model is composed of a parabolic dish mirror and a flat disk receiver located in the focal plane of the mirror and centred at the focal point.

For simplicity, we are going to assume that the mirror is a perfect specular mirror of ideal paraboloidal shape and the receiver is a perfect absorber of ideal flat disk shape.

We are going to use the following values for the parameters defining the geometry of dish and the receiver:

  # Parabolic mirror
    * Radius = 5 meters
    * Focal length = 6.0454798 meters
  # Flat disk receiver
    * Radius = 0.06 meters

Such a parabolic dish, which has an f-Number (ratio of the focal length to the dish diameter) of 0.60454798, achieves the maximum geometric concentration ratio for a parabolic dish.

== Creating the Group Node tree structure ==

After starting Tonatiuh release 2.0.1, do the following:

  # Add a Group Node to the !RootNode and label it "!ConcentratingSystem".
  # Add a Group Node to the "!ConcentratingSystem" Group Node and label it "!ParabolicDish".
  # Add a second Group Node to the "!ConcentratingSystem" Group Node and label it "!Receiver".

After doing this, Tonatiuh's user interface should look like this:

The 3D pane view located to the left of Tonatiuh's Graphics User Interface (GUI) does not show any surfaces, since we have not defined them yet. The Symbolic pane view located to the right of Tonatiuh's GUI shows the Group Node tree structure we have just created. In this tree structure, the Group Nodes represent three-dimensional reference frames. Each one of these reference frames can be translated and rotated with respect to the reference frame of their parents. The dimensions along the axes of each reference frame can be independently scaled. By default Tonatiuh creates the Group Note with the x-z plane as the horizontal plane and with the y-axis as the vertical axis, positive upwards. Since we have not changed the default parameters, the three reference frames created with the three Group Nodes just defined ("!ConcentratingSystem", "!ParabolicDish", "Receiver") are all coincident with the world reference frame represented by the Group Node "!RootNode".

== Modelling the parabolic dish ==

  # Click on the "!ParabolicDish" Group Node to select it. Add to it a Surface Node and keep the automatic label "!TShapeKit1" provided by Tonatiuh.
  # Click on the just created "!TShapeKit1" Surface Node and add to it:
    * A "!Parabolic_Dish" node.
    * A "!Specular_Standard_Material" node.

After doing this, if you select within the "View" menu the option "Edit Mode" and set up the four 3D-Windows of the 3D pane view appropriately, Tonatiuh's user interface should look like this:

https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oPSZUatZbKI/Ur9uYW4CZ2I/AAAAAAAAE6E/oaRBUlX0AQU/w1118-h603-no/Tutorial_ParabolicDish_V201_TonatiuhScreenCapture02.JPG

As Tonatiuh's GUI shows, we have managed to create a parabolic dish. However, the parabolic dish that we have created is not the parabolic dish we wanted to model. The reason for this is that we have not changed the default values that Tonatiuh assigns to any newly created parabolic dish. This default values are:

  * A focal length "focusLength" of 0.125 meters.
  * A minimum radius "dishMinRadius" of 0.1 meters.
  * A maximum radius "dishMaxRadius" of 0.5 meters.
  * A maximum rotational angle "phiMax" of 2 Pi.
  * An active side for representation purposes "activeSide" of "OUTSIDE".

Obviously, we have to change the values assigned to some of the above listed variables to model the parabolic dish we are interested in. The changes that we need to carry out are the following:

  * Change the focal length "focusLength" to 6.0454798 meters.
  * Change the minimum radius "dishMinRadius" to 0. meters.
  * Change the maximum radius "dishMaxRadius" to 5 meters.
  * Change the  active side for representation purposes "activeSide" to "INSIDE".

After doing this, Tonatiuh's user interface should look like this:

Although, we have modelled the geometry of the parabolic dish, we still have to model its physical properties. To do this, we select the "Specular_Standard_Material" node and change the values of the following variables from their default values to the following ones:

  * m_reflectivity = 1 (default value 0)
  * m_sigmaSlope = 0 (default value 2)

By setting the reflectivity to 1 and the sigma slope to 0 we are telling Tonatiuh that the mirror should be modelled as an ideal specular reflective mirror that follows exactly Descarte's law of reflection.

== Modelling the flat disk receiver ==

  # Click on the "Receiver" Group Node to select it and change the value of the translation variable from "0 0 0" to "0 6.0454798 0" in order to translate the flat disk's reference frame in the vertical y-direction and place its origin at the focal point of the mirror.
  # Add to the "Receiver" Group Node a Surface Node and keep the automatic label "TShapeKit1" provided by Tonatiuh.
  # Click on the just created "TShapeKit1" Surface Node and add to it:
    * A "!Flat_Disk" node.
    * A "!Specular_Standard_Material" node.
  # Select the "!Flat_Disk" node and change the "radius" from 0.5 meters (default) to 0.06 meters, and the "activeSide" from "FRONT" to "BACK".

After doing this, if you select within the "View" menu the option "Edit Mode" and set up the four 3D-Windows of the 3D pane view appropriately, Tonatiuh's user interface should look like this:

= Modelling the direct solar radiation =

  # From Tonatiuh's menu bar select "Environment>Sun Light>Define !SunLight" in order to make the program to display the "Define !SunLight" dialog. 
  # In the "Sun Shape" tab of that dialogue, select "!Pillbox_Sunshape" as the "Sunshape Type".
  # Accept the default values provided by the program for the direct solar irradiance (1000 W/m2) and for the maximums half angle subtended by the direct solar radiation, "thetaMax" (0.00465 radians or 16 minutes of arc) and click "OK".

We do not need to change the azimuth and elevation of the sun vector, because by default the azimuth is considered 0 degrees and the elevation 90 degrees, that is, the sun vector, by default, is defined in the y-direction pointing upwards and, therefore, aligned with the optical axis of the parabolic mirror we just modelled.

= Ray tracing with Tonatiuh =

Once we have modelled the solar concentrating system and the incoming direct solar radiation, we are ready to run Tonatiuh in order to ray trace rays from the Sun into the concentrating system and collect the ray traced rays for post processing outside Tonatiuh.

To specify how many rays we want to generate, and other ray tracing options we go to the main menu bar and select "Ray Trace>Ray Trace Options" in order to make the program to display the "Ray Trace Options" pop up dialogue, shown in the Figure below.

In this dialog let us just modify the number of rays to be traced by Tonatiuh from the default value of 10000 to 75 million rays.
