#summary Analysis of the flux distribution at the focal plane of a Parabolic Dish using Tonatiuh release 2.0.1

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains how to use Tonatiuh release 2.0.1 to model a parabolic dish and simulate its optical behaviour. It also explains how to use Mathematica to process the output from Tonatiuh to estimate the concentrated solar flux distribution at the focal plane of the parabolic dish and related parameters, such as the maximum radius of such distribution, i.e., the size of the solar spot at the parabolic dish focal plane.
